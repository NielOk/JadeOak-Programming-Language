# JadeOak-Programming-Language
High-Level Programming Language for JadeOak OS. 
This programming language was created for my JadeOak OS operating system, and it was made from Python. Check the "example.jadeoak" file
for a little bit of a tutorial on how to write in the JadeOak Programming Language, or you can look at the source code for more clues. In general, it is like Python except the language is a little easier to understand.
