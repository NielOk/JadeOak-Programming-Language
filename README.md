# JadeOak-Programming-Language
Function-based, high-level programming language built on top of Python. Designed for easy, quick function writing and testing before moving it into actual practice with Python. Helps organize and test complex function ideas a developer may have. Very helpful for experienced developers with writing functions (think of it as a testable "brain dump" programming language). 
Check the "example.jadeoak" file for a little bit of a tutorial on how to write in the JadeOak Programming Language, or you can look at the source code for more clues. In general, it is like Python except it has shorter syntax and a slightly different code structure, purposefully made for quick code writing and testing.
